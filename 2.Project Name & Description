TensorFlow for RegressionTensorFlow for Regression

Used the kc_house_data.csv data , a house dataset 
where we try to predct the price based on various features. 
We do some Exploratory Data Analysis and some data cleaning
to extract as much possible information from the available data.
We then split the data into training and testing using Scikit learn. 
We then do some data pre-processing by scaling the data using MinMaxScaler.
We then import Sequential Model and Dense Layer from keras 
API packaged inside tensorflow (tensorflow.keras).
We then place sequence of Dense Layers and in the end compile the
model and fit it to our training dataset. In the end we evaluate the performance of our model.
