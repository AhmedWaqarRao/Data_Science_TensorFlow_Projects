TensorFlow for ClassificationTensorFlow for Classification
Used the cancer_classification.csv data , a cancer dataset 
where we try to classify 2 categorical classes benign or 
malignant of lung cancer using various features present in the dataset. 
We do some Exploratory Data Analysis to get acquainted to our dataset. 
We then split the data into training and testing using Scikit learn.
We then do some data pre-processing by scaling the data using MinMaxScaler. 
We then import Sequential Model and Dense Layer
from keras API packaged inside tensorflow (tensorflow.keras).
We then place sequence of Dense Layers 
and in the end compile the model and fit it to our training dataset. 
We also use the concept of early stoppings in ths case, in which
we stop the training early if the losses on validation 
data starts increasing during the training. In the end we evaluate the performance of our model.
